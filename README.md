# DatabaseManager (in-game)
Hi, this is a database manager to (obviously) manager all your databases in-game from Minecraft.
I will keep this project up to date every time I can and if I see something to update of course.

## TODO
- [x] Config file
- [ ] Permissions
- [x] Database list
- [x] Table list
- [ ] Table administration (90% done)
- [ ] Column list
- [ ] Entity list
- [ ] Actions
- [ ] Basic security
- [ ] Advanced security
- More TODOs will be added here.

If you have any ideas you can message me through Discord (Baguette#8980), Telegram (@BadLost17) or just open an issue ticket (even if issue tickets were not made for that purpose lol).
